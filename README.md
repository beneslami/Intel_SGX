# Intel SGX

Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) is a set of extensions on 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th generations of
the Intel Core processor, Intel Xeon processor E3-1500 versions 5 and 6 and E-2100 family.
SGX extension provides hardware-based isolation and memory encryption to provide more code protection
for developers. It aims also to provide confidentiality and integrity guarantee to security-sensitive
data and computation where all privileged softwares such as kernel and hypervisors are potentially malicious. In other words, the security model of Intel SGX states that only the CPU needs to be trusted and all software including applications and the operating system is considered untrusted. Secured containers which is called  enclaves are protected by hardware mechanisms and no malicious application, operating system or virtual machine monitor can access the information in enclaves. Furthermore, the memory belonging to these enclaves is transparently encrypted by the CPU to defend against physical hardware attacks and they can attest their current state to a remote party to prove that they have not been modified during loading. SGX-enabled processors offer two crucial properties:
* Isolation which means each enclave's environment is isolated from the untrusted software outside of the enclave,
* Attestation: This property allows a remote party to authenticate the software running inside an enclave.

An application using Intel SGX extension is built in trusted and un-trusted parts. The application creates an enclave inside its own address space and puts trusted part into that enclave. When the application calls trusted part, it will run in a completely protected mode and external access to enclave data is completely denied.

Enclave code and data are placed in a special memory area called the Enclave Page Cache (EPC). This memory area is encrypted using the Memory Encryption Engine (MEE), a new and dedicated chip. The Enclave Page Cache Map (EPCM) structure is used to store the pages state. It is located inside the protected memory and its size limits the size of the EPC.

Intel SGX is the newest technology to solve Secure Remote Computation problem by leveraging trusted hardware
in the remote computer. Secure Remote Computation is the problem of executing software on a remote computer
owned and maintained by an untrusted party. The trusted hardware establishes a secure container, and the remote computation service user uploads the desired computation and data into the secure container. The trusted hardware protects the dataâ€™s confidentiality and integrity while the computation is being performed on it. For example, a cloud service that performs image processing on confidential medical images could be implemented by having users upload encrypted images. The users would send the encryption keys to software running inside an enclave. The enclave would contain the code for decrypting images, the image processing algorithm, and the code for encrypting the results. The code that receives the uploaded encrypted images and stores them would be left outside the enclave. While SGX provides confidentiality and integrity of the data and computation inside an enclave by isolating it from outside environment, it remains compatible with traditional software layering in the Intel Architecture.

There are three important parameters that collectively guarantee the security of a system:
* confidentiality: A feature which guarantees receiver that the received data was not recognizable by any third entity. This can be implemented by encrypting the data.
* Integrity: A feature which guarantees the receiver that the received data is remained intact. This can be implemented by putting data hash near the data.
* Freshness: A feature which guarantees the receiver that the received data is the latest and the newest one. Freshness guarantees are typically built on top of a system that already offers integrity guarantees, by adding a unique piece of information to each message. A popular solution for gaining freshness guarantees relies on nonces, single-use random numbers. Nonces are attractive because the sender does not need to maintain any state; the receiver, however, must store the nonces of all received messages.
